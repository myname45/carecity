<h3>Welcome the github repository of CARECITY.</h3>

<p> 
CareCity is a project, or formally a website that aims to enhance the development of a city in a sustainable fashion and promote environment friendly activities and measures by reducing the friction involved in doing so. 
Our website aims to display the map of any particular city and most importantly display the environment friendly businesses, recycling centres, cleaning drives etc. 
For those purposes, we have made an interface using HTML, that displays all the pages of our website. 
For locating the centres and providing details about them, we intend to integrate Google Maps API and Google places API respectively. 
There is one main branch for the entire front-end codebase of the website, and all other integrations will be done in separate branches.
